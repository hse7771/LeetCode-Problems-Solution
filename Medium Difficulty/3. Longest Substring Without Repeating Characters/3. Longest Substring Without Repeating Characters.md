# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The first idea that might come to mind to solve this problem is to go through all possible variants of unique characters. However, it is not efficient enough as much as it might be.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
It is sufficient to iterate through the string only once and when the repeated character is found to set the counter to the next symbol after it and update the set of symbols that are already used respectievly.
1. Create hash table for used characters.
2. Iterate through the loop updating the start point of the current string.
3. Update maximum length.
4. Return the result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The time complexity is $O(N)$, as no more than $N$ iterations may be performed to solve the problem and searching operation is performed for $O(1)$ thanks to hash table efficiency.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The space complexity is $O(N)$, where $N$ is the length of the string, to store it. The extra space needed to remember characters used stores no more than $N$ characters, therefore it would be $O(N)$ anyway.

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        current = {}
        cur_start = 0
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] not in current:
                current[s[i]] = i
            else:
                if cur_start < current[s[i]] + 1:
                    cur_start = current[s[i]] + 1
                current[s[i]] = i
            count = max(count, i - cur_start + 1)
        return count
